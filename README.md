# A Social-Network Based Music Recommendation System

For this assignment, we were provided three files: 

- A file containing information about 17632 artists
- A file containing 92834 user-listened artist relations
- A file containing 12717 user-friend relations

Five main methods were required, one that lists the friends of a user given their user ID, one that prints
the common friends between two users, one that lists the artists listened to by two users, one that
lists the top 10 most listened artists by all users, and one that recommends 10 popular artists based
on a user's friend group.
